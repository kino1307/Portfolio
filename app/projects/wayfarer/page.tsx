                        <p>
                            I wanted a way to turn a plain-English question &mdash; &quot;South American capitals&quot;,
                            &quot;Beatles birthplaces&quot; &mdash; into a map, without either hand-writing SPARQL
                            against Wikidata for every query shape or trusting an LLM&apos;s raw output, which sounds
                            just as confident whether or not it&apos;s actually right. Most &quot;ask an LLM to find
                            some places&quot; demos skip the second half of that problem entirely: they show you a
                            pin and never tell you whether it&apos;s real.
                        </p>

                        <p className="mb-4">
                            Wikidata is the source of truth; the LLM is only a narrow translator and fallback. Given
                            that, a smaller/cheaper model is viable and the critical path is the quality of SPARQL
                            generation and entity disambiguation, not raw model horsepower.
                        </p>
                        <div className="space-y-6">

                                <p>
                                    Instead of a fixed library of query templates, the agent reads Wikidata&apos;s own
                                    schema at query time: it searches for the relevant properties and classes, probes
                                    how real instances are modelled, and builds and tests a SPARQL query live against
                                    Wikidata before it&apos;s ever proposed as an answer. The same code path handles
                                    &quot;South American capitals&quot; and &quot;WWI Western Front battlefields&quot;
                                    with no query-type branch &mdash; a single-point capital and a multi-point
                                    battlefield list go through identical logic.
                                </p>

                                    Before a result reaches the map it&apos;s checked along independent axes: does
                                    each row match the expected type, does the row count look sane, does a second,
                                    independent check on a sample of results hold up. A failed check triggers one
                                    bounded repair pass; if the query still can&apos;t be trusted, the result is
                                    downgraded rather than dropped &mdash; nothing vanishes silently.

                                    Every pin carries two independent trust labels: coordinate trust (verified from
                                    Wikidata&apos;s own data → geocoded → approximate) and membership trust
                                    (confirmed by a real Wikidata relationship vs. the model&apos;s own unverified
                                    claim). A pin only reads as fully clean when both are at their strongest tier;
                                    anything weaker is visibly flagged in the UI rather than blended in with verified
                                    results.
                                </p>

                                    No server-side LLM key. Users bring their own Anthropic or OpenAI key, entered in
                                    the browser and sent per request via header, never logged or stored server-side.
                                    The API layer&apos;s provider dispatch is a single function keyed off a model-id
                                    prefix, so adding OpenAI&apos;s GPT-5.6 line-up alongside the original Claude
                                    integration was a same-day change rather than a rewrite.

                                    If Wikidata has no structured answer for a query &mdash; subjective or very
                                    recent topics &mdash; the app falls back to curated model knowledge instead of
                                    returning nothing. Every result from that path is honestly labelled
                                    &quot;model-suggested&quot;, never presented as grounded.

                                    queries for free, since the underlying Wikidata data barely changes day to day.
                                    The app ships as two Docker containers &mdash; an Express API and an nginx-served
                                    Vite build &mdash; behind a Caddy reverse proxy.
